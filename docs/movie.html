        <p> Shadow and Bone Show Poster </p>
        <p> My favorite show is Shadow and Bone. The Netflix series is based on Leigh Bardugoâ€™s Grishaverse books, which consists of three series. The show combines the first series, Shadow and Bone, with prequel information to the second series, Six of Crows, that was not in the books. It is a high paced fantasy story that follows Alina Starkov, a girl who can summon the mystical powers of light. It follows her journey to possibly save the world while the characters from Six of Crows are on a heist to capture her. I love this series so much because the characters are relatable, and it is just a great fantasy series. The characters from Six of Crows are unapologetically ruthless with a unique storyline. I find myself in many of the characters.  Out of the 7 books, the last one is my favorite. It combines all of the characters into one final mission for the world. The Grishaverse series is definitely one of my favorite book and show series.  </p>

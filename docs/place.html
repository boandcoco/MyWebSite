        <p> Biltmore Estate </p>
        <p> Nestled in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina, Biltmore Estate resides. Built for George Vanderbilt II from 1889 to 1895, Biltmore takes the spot as the largest privately owned house in the USA. The house sits on 8,000 acres with a winery, gardens, and beautiful forest trails. The Biltmore is my favorite place because I love the history and architecture. My dream is to travel to Europe, so this house/museum is my favorite place to visit in the USA that gives the same feel as Europe. I also read a book series that was heavily inspired and set at the Biltmore. Although the book was a fantasy novel, it told the history of the estate in an accurate way. I love the massive library and gardens. Biltmore is a great place for a family to visit. I would love to go back in the spring; I have visited around Christmas and summer. </p>

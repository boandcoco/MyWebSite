        <h2> About My Dogs </h2>
        <p> I love dogs! I have one silver labrador retriever, two standard poodles, one labradoodle, and two rescue dogs. Last month, I bred my silver lab with my black poodle. She had twelve puppies, and I am keeping one. Dogs are my favorite pets! </p>
        <h2> My Favorite Books </h2>
        <p> Fantasy books are my favorite type to read. I love the Grishaverse world which consists of three series. I also love The Song of Achilles, Throne of Glass, Vicious, and so many more. I find reading as an escape from the world and my favorite pastime.  </p>
